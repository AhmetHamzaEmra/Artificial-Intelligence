# Artificial Intelligence Lab Reporsitory

**Project SpaceModel**

- Electronic book source: www.gutenberg.org
- Neural Network source : www.neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com

### Description of project

Using an electronic book, we choose a random chapter and remove
all blank spaces between words. Example "The brown fox jumps"
will be converted into "Thebrownfoxjumps". Next we will teach
a model to utilize the rest of the chapters in the book and create 
an English model to learn from and correct the target chapter. 
This requires the use of a recursive neural network and unsurpervised
learning techiqnue.
